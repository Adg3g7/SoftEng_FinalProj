## What is The Super Senses?

###### The Super Senses is the final project for our Software Engineering Class where we used the SCRUM process to create a trailer for a movie and a website to accompany it. It is titled "The Super Senses" because it is based on superheroes that have one sense more powerful than normal each.

## Why we chose to do The Super Senses

###### For our project we decided on making a trailer for a movie and a website to accompany it. Our team is all Information Technology majors, and instead of making some kind of app, we decided to use some of the skills that we have been taught in our IT classes as well as work on some skills that we might find useful post college. The making of a trailer and making of a website provided members with a compromise of being able to do media creation and website development as well as the experience of creating a topic that blended the two that we wouldn't have had the experience of previously.

## Process of completing The Super Senses

#### First Sprint - Planning Sprint:

###### To begin the project, we started off listing and deciding on project ideas. Our top 5 topic selections can be seen [here.](ideas.md) 

###### After choosing to do a trailer and website, we had to come up with an idea of what to make the project about. We decided on a superhero movie because it would tie the trailer and website together the best. After brainstorming we came up with using superheroes that have enhanced senses, but only one each.

###### From there we started setting the scene. Because we were making a trailer we had to have some idea as to what the original plot would look like. Once we knew what would potentially happen in the movie, we could make a promo for it. This process started with making some notes on what the characters would be like. You can see the notes for the character descriptions [here.](charactersDescription.md)

###### We continued planning what could happen in the movie we were making a trailer for by coming up with a short and generalized plot for the movie. The plot synopsis can be viewed [here.](plotLine.md)

###### Once we had an idea what to make the trailer after we began work on the script of the trailer. The alpha build of the script can be viewed [here.](InitialScript.md)

###### The script took many revisions before we settled on a finalized product and changed a bit during filming as well. Our finalized script can be viewed [here.](FinalScript.md)

#### Second Sprint - Filming and Editing Sprint:

###### To start the second sprint we had to get and organize volunteer actors. (Thanks to members of the Marching Mizzou Trombone Section) This involved making a schedule of filming based on availability of the actors, and film crew. We were able to split them into two blocks of filming.

###### Next came the filming. We filmed the two different blocks of actors in the same week making sure to get enough footage to cut around in order to film at least a minute of footage while following the script.

###### Finally, we had to edit the footage into a trailer. Total editing time for the trailer was around 7 hours including some Photoshop work to. Video can be seen at [this youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR3EEEJBTiI), or alternatively on the website.

#### Third Sprint - Website Development and Behind the Scenes:

###### With remaining footage we decided to make a behind the scenes video and director's cut that we included to be used on the website. Total editing time took around 3 hours for the two videos. The behind the scenes video featured a look at unused footage and a bit into the process of filming edited to be comedic. Behind the scenes youtube link can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L1cMk3g_a8), or on the website. Also the director's cut which was just a quick video to share with the actors themselves which we decided to throw onto the website. That video can be seen at [this youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeIQsFkPAVA)

###### Work then began on the website. Included in the website are the trailer, as well as both behind the scenes video as well as bios for the heroes and the villains.

###### Finally, we started cleaning up the project repo including converting documents to markdown, and worked on the video presentation
